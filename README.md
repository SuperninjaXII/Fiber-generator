- Creates directories and files for views, public assets, routes, and controllers.

- Initializes a Go module using `go mod init`.
- Includes a `Makefile` to manage common tasks like installing dependencies, building, and running the project.

## Requirements

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Make (optional, but recommended for using the `Makefile`)
